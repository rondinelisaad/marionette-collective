Detail for Marionette Collective message PLMC5
===========================================

Example Message
---------------

    Received a control message, possibly via 'mco controller' but this has been deprecated

Additional Information
----------------------

In previous versions of MCollective a application called 'controller' were included that had the ability to request agent reloads and other commands that would control the runner.

Unfortunately this method of controlling the daemon was never considered stable or reliable and has since been deprecate for removal during the 2.3.x development series
